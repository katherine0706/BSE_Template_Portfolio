# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the Useless Machine. When the switch on the outside of the box is flipped, it powers a motor that is attached to an arm which moves to flip the switch in the opposite direction, causing the motor to spin in the opposite direction, bringing the arm back to its original position. The motor includes a piece of metal in the middle coiled by wire, which turns it into a magnet when electricity from the batteries runs through it. This magnet is surrounded by another magnet, and each of these magnets has a north pole on one side and a south pole on the other side. When the north side of one magnet meets the north side of the other magnet, the alike forces repel each other, causing the inner magnet to move a half rotation. The motor is able to move another half rotation when electromagnetic energy causes the charges of the poles of the outer magnet to switch, which places the north side of one magnet near the north side of the other magnet, causing the inner magnet to move another half rotation. At this point, the motor has spun a full rotation. This process repeats, allowing the motor to spin. 

This project helped me to learn how to solder, but I had difficulties along the way. While soldering, it was taking me a long time to melt the solder. Later I realized that I had forgotten to tin the tip of my solder iron, which was slowing me down and causing me to lose efficiency while soldering. When I started tinning the tip of my iron, I found that the process went by much faster and made mental notes to periodically re-tin my tip when I was soldering.
